# Binaural vs. In-Studio 7.1.4 Mix Evaluation

## Evaluation Criteria

Each teammate should evaluate the mix based on the following attributes and provide scores (1-10) along with comments.

| Attribute                  | Description                                                          | Brad | Jacob | Joel | Lydia | Mike | Comments |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- | -------- |
| **Spatial Accuracy**       | How well does the mix position sounds in 3D space?                   |      |       |      |       |      |          |
| **Timbre Consistency**     | Does the tonal balance remain natural and consistent across formats? |      |       |      |       |      |          |
| **Immersion & Depth**      | Does the mix create an engaging, enveloping experience?              |      |       |      |       |      |          |
| **Clarity & Detail**       | Are subtle elements (reverbs, transients) preserved well?            |      |       |      |       |      |          |
| **Low-Frequency Response** | How well does the bass translate between formats?                    |      |       |      |       |      |          |
