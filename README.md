# Binaural Convolution Processing

## Setup

- setup a python virtual environment with 64 bit python
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## File Structure Overview

The **IR-directory** contains multiple **subdirectories**, each representing a person (e.g., `Person1`, `Person2`, etc.). Each **person's directory** contains:

### Impulse Response Files (IRs)

- A set of **stereo `.wav` files** that correspond to the **7.1.4 channel speaker configuration**.
- The file names correspond to the positions in a 7.1.4 surround system:
  - `frontleft.wav`, `frontright.wav`, `frontcenter.wav`
  - `sideleft.wav`, `sideright.wav`
  - `backleft.wav`, `backright.wav`
  - `topfrontleft.wav`, `topfrontcenter.wav`, `topfrontright.wav`
  - `lfe1.wav` (low-frequency effects channel)
  - `voiceofgod.wav` (likely an overhead source)

The top level directory contains

### "out" Directory (Located in the Top-Level Directory)

- This subdirectory will store the **binaural output** after processing for each person

### "in" File (Located in the Top-Level Directory)

- A **12-channel `.wav` file** that serves as the input.
- This file will be **convolved** with the **impulse response files** from each person's folder to generate personalized binaural audio.

## Objective

- The program should iterate through each **person's directory**, access their **7.1.4 stereo impulse response `.wav` files**, and perform convolution with the **12-channel input file** from the `"in"` directory.
- The resulting **binaural output** should be stored in each **person's `"out"` directory**.

## Usage Instructions

1. Place the **12-channel input `.wav` file** inside the `"in"` directory.
2. Assure the IR-directory is setup properly based on (file structure)[Impulse Response Files (IRs)]
3. Run the Python script to perform convolution and generate binaural audio.
4. The output files will be saved inside `"out"` directory.

## Convolution Method

- The script uses **Scipy's `signal.convolve` function** to convolve the input file with the impulse responses.
- Impulse responses are trimmed to **0.5 seconds** to remove irrelevant tail noise.
- The output is **normalized** before being saved.

## Running the Script

```sh
python conv.py
```
